## How it works!
I did this App usin swift progamming language and some libraries and APIÂ´s that this laguage offer.
First of all, whe you enter to the application, you will see on the top a button to create a new note. Additionally, you can click in a note to edit and swipe to the left to delete the note.

I did this App using a SQLite3 database to store the notes.
