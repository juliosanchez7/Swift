## How it works!
I did this App usin swift progamming language and some libraries and APIÂ´s that this laguage offer.
First of all, whe you enter to the application, the application offer the option to choose an image from your gallery or you can take the photo inside of the application.

### Then, the magic begins.

A machine learning model is in charge of classifying the type of animal in the photo. I was able to achieve this thanks to the ML library that Apple offers with Swift !. The ML model is an Apple pre-trained model, which can be found at: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml
Additionally, the application includes text to speech to inform the user in an auditory way of what type of classification that the App has achieved
