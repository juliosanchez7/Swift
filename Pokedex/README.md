## How it works!
I did this App usin swift progamming language and some libraries and APIÂ´s that this laguage offer.
First of all, whe you enter to the application, you will see a list of more than 150 Pokemon. Here you can search by name with the search tab on the top. 

When you click a pokemon, you can see an image of the Pokemon and some important data about the Pokemon. Additionally, you can fin a catch button that you can click it to catch them!.

I did this project using the https://pokeapi.co API to find all the dataset about the Pokemon.
